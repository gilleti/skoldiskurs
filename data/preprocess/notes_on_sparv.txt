This is a reminder on how Sparv works. It is moot now because we ended up not using Sparv but I still want to make a note of it in case we forget at a later point in time. Sparv is a command line tool so there are no Python scripts to tell the story.

Sparv was deemed too slow to use in this project but some findings that could be relevant here is that: (1) small files are bad for the performance of Sparv as it reads SALDO in to memory every time we process a new file. There is a pre-loader but it doesn't help much. (2) There is no way to just do any sort of pre-processing with Sparv without also doing dependency parsing. That's why it's so incredibly slow.

We ended up just using Stanza, which is the underlying library of Sparv.
